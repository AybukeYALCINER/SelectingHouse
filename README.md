# SelectingHouse
Mr. McCarthy and his family want to buy a new house. There are five houses they like, but they must consider several factors to decide which the best one is. These factors are the initial cost of the house, the estimated annual fuel costs, and annual tax rate. This program will determine the total cost after a 10 year period for each set of a house data in “HouseData.txt” file. We read the costs from file and put them in a two-dimensional list named bulletList. Use “ ” (keyboard space bar) as delimiter.  Implement three functions whose names are calculateTotalCost(), displayCosts() and selectBestBuy().  
> calculateTotalCost() function should calculate the total cost after 10 year period for each house and put the results in a list named ResultList.  <br>
HINT: To calculate the total house cost, add the taxes for 10 years and the fuel cost for 10 years to initial house cost. Taxes for 10 years can be calculated by multiplying initial house cost by tax rate and 10. 

> displayCosts()  function should display the total costs of all houses calculated in CalculateTotalCost() function. 

> selectBestBuy() function should determine which house they should buy, of course, it should be the cheapest one in the overall.  
 
> calculateTotalCost() function should be called by other functions.
